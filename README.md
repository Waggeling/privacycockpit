# privacycockpit

I developed this project during my position as a research assistant at Fraunhofer IOSB in Karlsruhe. It can be viewed [here](https://gitlab-ext.iosb.fraunhofer.de/bst/privacycockpit).

## Description
PrivacyCockpit is a dashboard prototype for better overall view of data and their permissions, with focus on SmartHome devices. The user can view which device got access to which data and can manage (view, create, edit, delete) it very easily. It also includes the set of trustworthiness of devices and rights to transfer to third parties. A deadline for the storage of data can also be set during the processing of the inbox.

## Project structure

The project uses the frameworks [Angular 7](https://angular.io/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), together with the runtime environment [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). The server-sided database is [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
